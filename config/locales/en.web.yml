        content: 'A service where teams can track the quality of their public repositories. Repositories are connected to the project, which are then checked through the github check mechanism (<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/checks">GitHub</a>).
                  The result is displayed both in the github interface and on the service itself.'
