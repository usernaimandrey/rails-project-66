        content: 'A service where teams can track the quality of their public repositories. Repositories are connected to the project, which are then checked through the github check mechanism (<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/checks">GitHub</a>).
                  The result is displayed both in the github interface and on the service itself.'

      server_error:
        header: Something went wrong
        explanation: Hmm, it looks like we have a bug in the code. The programmers have already sent a message, it remains to wait a bit. In the meantime, you can try to walk around in other sections (if they work)
      not_found:
        header: Oops, it's empty
        explanation: This happens when a page has been deleted or an error has accidentally crept into the address. But it's okay, you can just click on any menu item from above and get to the right place
